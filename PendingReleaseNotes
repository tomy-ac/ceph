11.0.0
------

* If you have manually specified the monitor user rocksdb via the
  ``mon keyvaluedb = rocksdb`` option, you will need to manually add a file
  to the mon data directory to preserve this option::

     echo rocksdb > /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-`hostname`/kv_backend

  New monitors will now use rocksdb by default, but if that file is
  not present, existing monitors will use leveldb.  The ``mon keyvaluedb`` option
  now only affects the backend chosen when a monitor is created.

* The 'osd crush initial weight' option allows you to specify a CRUSH
  weight for a newly added OSD.  Previously a value of 0 (the default)
  meant that we should use the size of the OSD's store to weight the
  new OSD.  Now, a value of 0 means it should have a weight of 0, and
  a negative value (the new default) means we should automatically
  weight the OSD based on its size.  If your configuration file
  explicitly specifies a value of 0 for this option you will need to
  change it to a negative value (e.g., -1) to preserve the current
  behavior.

* The `osd crush location` config option is no longer supported.  Please
  update your ceph.conf to use the `crush location` option instead.

* The static libraries are not included by the debian development packages
  (lib*-dev) any more. As it is not required per debian packaging policy.
  And their shared versions are packaged as before.

* The libtool pseudo-libraries (.la files) are not included by the debian
  development packages (lib*-dev) any more. As it is unneeded, and per
  https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/LAFileRemoval and
  https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/advanced.en.html,
  we should remove them.
